why a solution of sodium carbonate is alkaline in nature
why are lithium salts hydrated and other salts unhydrated
 
 due to small size of boron ,the sum of first three ionization energy is very very
 high,this prevents it to form +3 ion,so it forms covalent compound
 
 aluminum is the most abundant metal (she told this point 50 times)
 
 reason for anamolous behaviour of boron:  small size ,due to which size to charge ratio is very high 
 
 
 anomalous behaviour of boron
 
1-boron is the only non-metal
2-boron is a bad conductor of electricity as it is a non-metal,others are good conductors of electricity.
3-boron forms only covalent compound ,and other elements of grp13 forms ionic compound
4-boron shows allotropy and exists in crystalline and amorphous form

MOST IMPORTANT:

hydroxide and oxide of boron are acidic but others are amphoteric and basic


NOTE: all boron trihalides are hydrolysed to give boric acid

hydrates of boron is called diborate
